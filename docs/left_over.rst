In order to calculate :math:`\partial_{\lambda} \omega_{01}`, scqubits uses the standard approach of Taylor-expanding the Hamiltonian around some fixed value of :math:`\lambda=\lambda_0` [Ithier2005]_ [Groszkowski2018]_, and use 
u This lets us define the frequency derivative in terms of a matrix elements.
