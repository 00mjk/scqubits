"""
sc_qubits -  This module provides routines for the basic description of common superconducting qubits such as
the Cooper pair box/transmon, fluxonium etc. Each qubit is realized as a class, implementing relevant
methods including computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, plotting of energy spectra vs. a select
external parameter, etc.
