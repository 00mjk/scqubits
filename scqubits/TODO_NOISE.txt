noise ongoing TODO items:

- *** go through noise equations/units, and check for correctness ***

- figure out a nice way to deal with energy units 
    i.e. if H not in GHz in noise calcs will 2pis wrong 

- "preset" noise types for each of the qubits:
    transmon, fluxonium, zeropi, flux

    dephasing 1/f
        flux
        criticial current (multijunction qubits? average, mean, noise for each?)
        charge
        arbitrary (given a filter function)
    relaxation
        ohmic environment at temp T
        dialectric noise
		flux bias line
        purcell (zeropi)
        charge
        arbitrary noise

- might update how the default options are passed to functions; this would reduce the boiler method definitions at a cost
    of some helper _defult_options(noise) type functions.
        
- add a general dephasing noise with possibility of a filter fun i.e ~int sinc(omega' t) F(omega') domega'
    this will will allow to mimic what one should expect from dynamical decoupling type protocols

- 1/f dephasing second order calculations via matrix operators (messy! - use paper results)

- an easy routine that plots Tx vs parameter over some parameter range
    (think plot_evals_vs_paramvals())

- add "all qubit noise" type calculations (i.e 1/t1 = rate1 + rate2 + ...)

- documentation
    general descriptions of all channels
    all default constants used
    FACTORS OF 2PI RELATED TO UNITS USED 
    what noise channels are available for each qubit 
    
- add a (much) faster version of calculation 1/f noise by numerically calculating derivatives (and not using matrix elements)    
- split up demo_noise.ipynb and and noise related calcs to individual qubit notebooks (? maybe better this way??)
 
- unit testing for all qubits
