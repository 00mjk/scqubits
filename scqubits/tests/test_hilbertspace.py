List of things that could be tested:

The Qtip dict works properly (test sin() or dag() in InteractionTermStr)
InteractionTermStr and InteractionTerm can handle more than 2 operators being passed in
Test that you can get correct hamiltonians from ITStr and IT
The Identity wrapping is working properly on ITStr and IT
HilbertSpace can handle types of Qobj, ITStr, IT, and ITLegacy all at the same time
Add hc works for IT and ITStr
HilbertSpace wont accept additions to the interaction list that are of the wrong type
