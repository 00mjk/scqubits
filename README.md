# sc_qubits
Python library for superconducting qubits

`sc_qubits.py` provides basic routines for the superconducting qubits we use most frequently in our group (at least right now, may want to add more as time goes on):
- transmon/CPB
- fluxonium
- variants of the 0-pi qubit

`testing-sc_qubits.ipynb` is an ipython notebook testing the existing parts of the library.

The code is placed here not only for easy sharing, but also for working together to improve and extend it. (This works in the usual github way: create your own branch, make changes to your branch, commit changes, and when finished place a pull request so the group can take a look, comment on your changes if needed, and then merge your changes back into the master branch.)
